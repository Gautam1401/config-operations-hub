# Integration Dashboard - Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Date Filtering Logic ✅
**Issue**: Date filters were not using correct calendar month logic

**Fix Applied**:
- **Current Month**: Now correctly filters from 1st to last day of current calendar month
- **Next Month**: Filters from 1st to last day of next calendar month
- **2 Months From Now**: Filters from 1st to last day of month that is 2 months ahead
- **YTD**: Filters from January 1st of current year to latest data in dataset

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- ✅ December → January year rollover
- ✅ November → January (2 months ahead)
- ✅ Leap years (February 29th)
- ✅ Months with different day counts (28, 29, 30, 31)

**Code Location**: `integration_dashboard/utils/data_processor.py` → `filter_by_date_range()`

---

### 2. KPI Card Rendering ✅
**Issue**: KPI cards were not rendering as HTML, showing literal HTML code

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `render_kpi_cards()` function that builds HTML string
- Uses loop to apply color classes from `KPI_COLORS` mapping
- Renders using `st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True)`
- Cards now display properly with correct colors

**Code Location**: `integration_dashboard/app.py` → `render_kpi_cards()`

---

### 3. Selected KPI Highlighting ✅
**Issue**: Selected KPI had no visual indication

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `selected` class to KPI card when `st.session_state.integration_selected_kpi` matches
- Selected card now shows:
  - **Gold border** (#FFD700)
  - **Glow effect** (box-shadow with gold color)
  - **3px border** for clear visual distinction

**CSS Applied** (from `shared/styles.py`):
```css
.kpi-card.selected {
    border: 3px solid #FFD700;
    box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.6);
}
```

**Code Location**: `integration_dashboard/app.py` → `render_kpi_cards()`

## 📊 Date Filtering Details

### Current Month Logic
```python
# Example: Today is October 15, 2025
start_date = datetime(2025, 10, 1)   # October 1, 2025
end_date = datetime(2025, 10, 31)    # October 31, 2025
```

### Next Month Logic
```python
# Example: Today is October 15, 2025
start_date = datetime(2025, 11, 1)   # November 1, 2025
end_date = datetime(2025, 11, 30)    # November 30, 2025

# Example: Today is December 15, 2025
start_date = datetime(2026, 1, 1)    # January 1, 2026
end_date = datetime(2026, 1, 31)     # January 31, 2026
```

### 2 Months From Now Logic
```python
# Example: Today is October 15, 2025
start_date = datetime(2025, 12, 1)   # December 1, 2025
end_date = datetime(2025, 12, 31)    # December 31, 2025

# Example: Today is November 15, 2025
start_date = datetime(2026, 1, 1)    # January 1, 2026
end_date = datetime(2026, 1, 31)     # January 31, 2026

# Example: Today is December 15, 2025
start_date = datetime(2026, 2, 1)    # February 1, 2026
end_date = datetime(2026, 2, 28)     # February 28, 2026 (or 29 in leap year)
```

### YTD Logic
```python
# Example: Today is October 15, 2025
start_date = datetime(2025, 1, 1)    # January 1, 2025
end_date = max(df['Go Live Date'])   # Latest date in data
```

## 🎨 KPI Card Rendering

### Before (Broken)
```python
# This showed literal HTML code on screen
st.markdown(render_kpi_cards_modern(kpis, selected_kpi), unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
def render_kpi_cards(kpis: dict):
    """Render KPI cards using HTML with proper styling"""
    
    cards_html = '<div class="kpi-row">'
    
    for kpi_name, kpi_value in kpis.items():
        color_class = KPI_COLORS.get(kpi_name, 'kpi-grey')
        selected_class = 'selected' if kpi_name == st.session_state.integration_selected_kpi else ''
        
        cards_html += f'''
            <div class="kpi-card {color_class} {selected_class}">
                {kpi_value}
                <br />
                <span style="font-size:0.55em;">{kpi_name}</span>
            </div>
        '''
    
    cards_html += '</div>'
    st.markdown(cards_html, unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

## 🎯 Selection Highlighting

### Visual States

**Default State**:
- Background color based on KPI type
- No border
- Standard shadow

**Hover State**:
- Card lifts up (translateY(-4px))
- Enhanced shadow

**Selected State**:
- **Gold border** (3px solid #FFD700)
- **Glow effect** (box-shadow with gold)
- Background color remains same
- Clearly distinguishable from other cards
