# CRM Analytics v1.3.0 - Complete Implementation

## âœ… What Was Fixed & Added

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL FIX: Go Live Testing Failed Cases
**Problem:** Go Live Testing was only showing GTG cases, missing all failed tests.

**Root Cause:** Logic was checking for "Issues Found" but actual data has "No" for failures.

**Solution:**
- Updated logic to recognize "No" as failure
- Properly categorizes:
  - **Go Live Blocker**: Sample ADF or Data Migration failed (critical tests)
  - **Non-Blocker**: Inbound or Outbound Email failed (non-critical tests)
  - **Both**: Store has both blocker and non-blocker failures
  - **GTG**: All tests passed

**Results (YTD):**
- Total Tested: 67 stores
- GTG: 61 stores (91.0% GTG rate)
- **Blockers: 6 stores**
  - Go Live Blocker Only: 3 stores
  - Both Blocker & Non-Blocker: 3 stores
- Non-Blockers: 3 stores
