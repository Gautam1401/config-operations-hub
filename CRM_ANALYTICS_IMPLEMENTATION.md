# CRM Analytics Implementation - v1.2.0

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Analytics Calculator (`crm_dashboard/analytics/calculator.py`)
Calculates all analytics metrics for CRM dashboard:

#### Configuration Analytics
- Total stores, In Scope, Out of Scope counts
- Completion rate (In Scope / Total excluding None)
- Configuration type distribution (Standard vs Copy)
- Regional breakdown with performance metrics
- Out of Scope analysis by region with percentages

#### Pre Go Live Analytics
- Total, GTG, Partial, Fail counts
- GTG rate calculation
- Domain Updated vs Set Up Check breakdown
- Regional readiness metrics
- At-risk stores (<7 days to Go Live and not GTG)

#### Go Live Testing Analytics
- Total tested, GTG, Blockers, Non-Blockers counts
- GTG rate calculation
- Test-specific pass rates (Sample ADF, Inbound Email, Outbound Email, Data Migration)
- Weighted score distribution (Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement, Critical)
- Unable to test analysis by region

### 2. Analytics Visualizations (`crm_dashboard/analytics/visualizations.py`)
Interactive charts and visualizations using Plotly:

- **Metric Cards**: Key metrics display
- **Completion Rate Chart**: Bar chart showing status distribution
- **Regional Heatmap**: Performance by region and status
- **Pie Charts**: Configuration type, Pre Go Live status, Domain/Setup breakdown
- **Out of Scope Analysis**: Color-coded cards with severity levels
- **Test Pass Rates**: Bar chart with pass/fail rates
- **Score Distribution**: Weighted score categories
- **At-Risk Stores Table**: Stores requiring immediate attention

### 3. Analytics Renderer (`crm_dashboard/analytics/renderer.py`)
Main renderer with 3 sub-tabs:

- **Configuration Tab**: Completion rates, regional performance, out-of-scope analysis
- **Pre Go Live Tab**: GTG rates, domain/setup breakdown, at-risk stores
- **Go Live Testing Tab**: Test pass rates, score distribution, unable to test analysis

### 4. Main App Integration (`crm_dashboard/app.py`)
- Updated to import analytics modules
- Analytics tab now fully functional
- Respects date filter selection (Current Month, Next Month, YTD)
- Version updated to 1.2.0
